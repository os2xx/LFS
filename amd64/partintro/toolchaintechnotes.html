        This section explains some of the rationale and technical details
        behind the overall build method. Don't try to immediately understand
        everything in this section. Most of this information will be clearer
        after performing an actual build. Come back and re-read this chapter
        at any time during the build process.

        The overall goal of <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Compiling a Cross-Toolchain">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>
        and <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Cross Compiling Temporary Tools">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
        is to produce a temporary area containing a set of tools that are
        known to be good, and that are isolated from the host system. By
        using the <span class="command"><strong>chroot</strong></span>
        command, the compilations in the remaining chapters will be isolated
        within that environment, ensuring a clean, trouble-free build of the
        target LFS system. The build process has been designed to minimize
        the risks for new readers, and to provide the most educational value
        at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This build process is based on <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>cross-compilation</em></span>. Cross-compilation is
        normally used to build a compiler and its associated toolchain for a
        machine different from the one that is used for the build. This is
        not strictly necessary for LFS, since the machine where the new
        system will run is the same as the one used for the build. But
        cross-compilation has one great advantage: anything that is
        cross-compiled cannot depend on the host environment.

          <p>
            The LFS book is not (and does not contain) a general tutorial to
            build a cross- (or native) toolchain. Don't use the commands in
            the book for a cross-toolchain for some purpose other than
            building LFS, unless you really understand what you are doing.
          </p>

        <p>
          Cross-compilation involves some concepts that deserve a section of
          their own. Although this section may be omitted on a first reading,
          coming back to it later will help you gain a fuller understanding
          of the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us first define some terms used in this context.
        </p>

            <dt>

            <dd>
              <p>
                is the machine where we build programs. Note that this
                machine is also referred to as the <span class=
                "quote">“<span class="quote">host.</span>”</span>
              </p>
            </dd>

              <span class="term">The host</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                is the machine/system where the built programs will run. Note
                that this use of <span class="quote">“<span class=
                "quote">host</span>”</span> is not the same as in other
                sections.
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>

            <dd>
              <p>
                is only used for compilers. It is the machine the compiler
                produces code for. It may be different from both the build
                and the host.
              </p>

          </dl>
        </div>
        <p>
          As an example, let us imagine the following scenario (sometimes
          referred to as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Canadian
          Cross</span>”</span>). We have a compiler on a slow machine only,
          let's call it machine A, and the compiler ccA. We also have a fast
          machine (B), but no compiler for (B), and we want to produce code
          for a third, slow machine (C). We will build a compiler for machine
          C in three stages.

          Then, all the programs needed by machine C can be compiled using
          cc2 on the fast machine B. Note that unless B can run programs
          produced for C, there is no way to test the newly built programs
          until machine C itself is running. For example, to run a test suite
          on ccC, we may want to add a fourth stage:

            Note
          </h3>
          <p>
            All the cross-compiled packages in this book use an
            autoconf-based building system. The autoconf-based building
            system accepts system types in the form cpu-vendor-kernel-os,
            referred to as the system triplet. Since the vendor field is
            often irrelevant, autoconf lets you omit it.
          </p>
          <p>
            An astute reader may wonder why a <span class=
            "quote">“<span class="quote">triplet</span>”</span> refers to a
            four component name. The kernel field and the os field began as a
            single <span class="quote">“<span class=
            "quote">system</span>”</span> field. Such a three-field form is
            still valid today for some systems, for example, <code class=
            "literal">x86_64-unknown-freebsd</code>. But two systems can
            share the same kernel and still be too different to use the same
            triplet to describe them. For example, Android running on a
            mobile phone is completely different from Ubuntu running on an
            ARM64 server, even though they are both running on the same type
            of CPU (ARM64) and using the same kernel (Linux).
          </p>
          <p>
            Without an emulation layer, you cannot run an executable for a
            server on a mobile phone or vice versa. So the <span class=
            "quote">“<span class="quote">system</span>”</span> field has been
            divided into kernel and os fields, to designate these systems
            unambiguously. In our example, the Android system is designated
            <code class="literal">aarch64-unknown-linux-android</code>, and
            the Ubuntu system is designated <code class=
            "literal">aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The word <span class="quote">“<span class=
            "quote">triplet</span>”</span> remains embedded in the lexicon. A
            simple way to determine your system triplet is to run the
            <span class="command"><strong>config.guess</strong></span> script
            that comes with the source for many packages. Unpack the binutils
            sources, run the script <strong class=
            "userinput"><code>./config.guess</code></strong>, and note the
            output. For example, for a 32-bit Intel processor the output will
            be <span class="emphasis"><em>i686-pc-linux-gnu</em></span>. On a
            64-bit system it will be <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</em></span>. On most Linux
            systems the even simpler <span class="command"><strong>gcc
            -dumpmachine</strong></span> command will give you similar
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should also be aware of the name of the platform's dynamic
            linker, often referred to as the dynamic loader (not to be
            confused with the standard linker <span class=
            "command"><strong>ld</strong></span> that is part of binutils).
            The dynamic linker provided by package glibc finds and loads the
            shared libraries needed by a program, prepares the program to
            run, and then runs it. The name of the dynamic linker for a
            32-bit Intel machine is <code class=
            "filename">ld-linux.so.2</code>; it's <code class=
            "filename">ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> on 64-bit systems. A
            sure-fire way to determine the name of the dynamic linker is to
            inspect a random binary from the host system by running:
            <strong class="userinput"><code>readelf -l &lt;name of binary&gt;
            | grep interpreter</code></strong> and noting the output. The
            authoritative reference covering all platforms is in <a class=
            "ulink" href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/ABIList">a Glibc
            wiki page</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In order to fake a cross-compilation in LFS, the name of the host
          triplet is slightly adjusted by changing the "vendor" field in the
          <code class="envar">LFS_TGT</code> variable so it says "lfs". We
          also use the <em class="parameter"><code>--with-sysroot</code></em>
          option when building the cross-linker and cross-compiler, to tell
          them where to find the needed host files. This ensures that none of
          the other programs built in <a class="xref" href=
          "../chapter06/chapter06.html" title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Cross Compiling Temporary Tools">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
          can link to libraries on the build machine. Only two stages are
          mandatory, plus one more for tests.

          This is not yet the end of the story. The C language is not merely
          a compiler; it also defines a standard library. In this book, the
          GNU C library, named glibc, is used (there is an alternative,
          "musl"). This library must be compiled for the LFS machine; that
          is, using the cross-compiler cc1. But the compiler itself uses an
          internal library providing complex subroutines for functions not
          available in the assembler instruction set. This internal library
          is named libgcc, and it must be linked to the glibc library to be
          fully functional. Furthermore, the standard library for C++
          (libstdc++) must also be linked with glibc. The solution to this
          chicken and egg problem is first to build a degraded cc1-based
          libgcc, lacking some functionalities such as threads and exception
          handling, and then to build glibc using this degraded compiler
          (glibc itself is not degraded), and also to build libstdc++. This
          last library will lack some of the functionality of libgcc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The upshot of the preceding paragraph is that cc1 is unable to
          build a fully functional libstdc++ with the degraded libgcc, but
          cc1 is the only compiler available for building the C/C++ libraries
          during stage 2. There are two reasons we don't immediately use the
          compiler built in stage 2, cc-lfs, to build those libraries.

                Generally speaking, cc-lfs cannot run on pc (the host
                system). Even though the triplets for pc and lfs are
                compatible with each other, an executable for lfs must depend
                on glibc-2.40; the host distro may utilize either a different
                implementation of libc (for example, musl), or a previous
                release of glibc (for example, glibc-2.13).

                Even if cc-lfs can run on pc, using it on pc would create a
                risk of linking to the pc libraries, since cc-lfs is a native
                compiler.

          So when we build gcc stage 2, we instruct the building system to
          rebuild libgcc and libstdc++ with cc1, but we link libstdc++ to the
          newly rebuilt libgcc instead of the old, degraded build. This makes
          the rebuilt libstdc++ fully functional.

          (or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">stage
          3</span>”</span>), all the packages needed for the LFS system are
          built. Even if a package has already been installed into the LFS
          system in a previous chapter, we still rebuild the package. The
          main reason for rebuilding these packages is to make them stable:
          if we reinstall an LFS package on a completed LFS system, the
          reinstalled content of the package should be the same as the
          content of the same package when first installed in <a class="xref"

          "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Cross Compiling Temporary Tools">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
          because of cross-compilation, causing the temporary packages to
          lack optional features, or use suboptimal code routines.
          Additionally, a minor reason for rebuilding the packages is to run
          the test suites.

        <p>
          The cross-compiler will be installed in a separate <code class=
          "filename">$LFS/tools</code> directory, since it will not be part
          of the final system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Binutils is installed first because the <span class=
          "command"><strong>configure</strong></span> runs of both gcc and
          glibc perform various feature tests on the assembler and linker to
          determine which software features to enable or disable. This is
          more important than one might realize at first. An incorrectly
          configured gcc or glibc can result in a subtly broken toolchain,
          where the impact of such breakage might not show up until near the
          end of the build of an entire distribution. A test suite failure
          will usually highlight this error before too much additional work
          is performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Binutils installs its assembler and linker in two locations,
          <code class="filename">$LFS/tools/bin</code> and <code class=
          "filename">$LFS/tools/$LFS_TGT/bin</code>. The tools in one
          location are hard linked to the other. An important facet of the
          linker is its library search order. Detailed information can be
          obtained from <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span> by
          passing it the <em class="parameter"><code>--verbose</code></em>
          flag. For example, <span class="command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-ld
          --verbose | grep SEARCH</strong></span> will illustrate the current
          search paths and their order. (Note that this example can be run as
          shown only while logged in as user <code class=
          "systemitem">lfs</code>. If you come back to this page later,
          replace <span class="command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-ld</strong></span>
          with <span class="command"><strong>ld</strong></span>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The next package installed is gcc. An example of what can be seen
          during its run of <span class=
          "command"><strong>configure</strong></span> is:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen"><code class=
        "computeroutput">checking what assembler to use... /mnt/lfs/tools/i686-lfs-linux-gnu/bin/as
checking what linker to use... /mnt/lfs/tools/i686-lfs-linux-gnu/bin/ld</code></pre>
        <p>
          This is important for the reasons mentioned above. It also
          demonstrates that gcc's configure script does not search the PATH
          directories to find which tools to use. However, during the actual
          operation of <span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>
          itself, the same search paths are not necessarily used. To find out
          which standard linker <span class=
          "command"><strong>gcc</strong></span> will use, run: <span class=
          "command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-gcc -print-prog-name=ld</strong></span>.
          (Again, remove the <span class=
          "command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-</strong></span> prefix if coming back
          to this later.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Detailed information can be obtained from <span class=
          "command"><strong>gcc</strong></span> by passing it the <em class=
          "parameter"><code>-v</code></em> command line option while
          compiling a program. For example, <span class=
          "command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-gcc -v <em class=
          "replaceable"><code>example.c</code></em></strong></span> (or
          without <span class="command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-</strong></span> if
          coming back later) will show detailed information about the
          preprocessor, compilation, and assembly stages, including
          <span class="command"><strong>gcc</strong></span>'s search paths
          for included headers and their order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next up: sanitized Linux API headers. These allow the standard C
          library (glibc) to interface with features that the Linux kernel
          will provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next comes glibc. The most important considerations for building
          glibc are the compiler, binary tools, and kernel headers. The
          compiler and binary tools are generally not an issue since glibc
          will always those relating to the <em class=
          "parameter"><code>--host</code></em> parameter passed to its
          configure script; e.g., in our case, the compiler will be
          <span class="command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-gcc</strong></span> and the
          <span class="command"><strong>readelf</strong></span> tool will be
          <span class="command"><strong>$LFS_TGT-readelf</strong></span>. The
          kernel headers can be a bit more complicated. Therefore, we take no
          risks and use the available configure switch to enforce the correct
          selection. After the run of <span class=
          "command"><strong>configure</strong></span>, check the contents of
          the <code class="filename">config.make</code> file in the
          <code class="filename">build</code> directory for all important
          details. These items highlight an important aspect of the glibc
          package—it is very self-sufficient in terms of its build machinery,
          and generally does not rely on toolchain defaults.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, the standard C++ library is compiled next,
          followed in <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html"
          title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Cross Compiling Temporary Tools">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
          by other programs that must be cross-compiled to break circular
          dependencies at build time. The install step of all those packages
          uses the <code class="envar">DESTDIR</code> variable to force
          installation in the LFS filesystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html"
          title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Cross Compiling Temporary Tools">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
          the native LFS compiler is installed. First binutils-pass2 is
          built, in the same <code class="envar">DESTDIR</code> directory as
          the other programs, then the second pass of gcc is constructed,
          omitting some non-critical libraries. Due to some weird logic in
          gcc's configure script, <code class="envar">CC_FOR_TARGET</code>
          ends up as <span class="command"><strong>cc</strong></span> when
          the host is the same as the target, but different from the build
          system. This is why <em class=
          "parameter"><code>CC_FOR_TARGET=$LFS_TGT-gcc</code></em> is
          declared explicitly as one of the configuration options.
        </p>

          Upon entering the chroot environment in <a class="xref" href=

          for the proper operation of the toolchain are performed. From this

          self-hosted. In <a class="xref" href="../chapter08/chapter08.html"

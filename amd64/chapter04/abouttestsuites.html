    </h1>
    <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
      <p>
        Most packages provide a test suite. Running the test suite for a
        newly built package is a good idea because it can provide a
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">sanity check</span>”</span>
        indicating that everything compiled correctly. A test suite that
        passes its set of checks usually proves that the package is
        functioning as the developer intended. It does not, however,
        guarantee that the package is totally bug free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some test suites are more important than others. For example, the
        test suites for the core toolchain packages—GCC, binutils, and
        glibc—are of the utmost importance due to their central role in a
        properly functioning system. The test suites for GCC and glibc can
        take a very long time to complete, especially on slower hardware, but
        are strongly recommended.

          is pointless; since the test programs are compiled with a
          cross-compiler, they probably can't run on the build host.

      <p>
        A common issue with running the test suites for binutils and GCC is
        running out of pseudo terminals (PTYs). This can result in a large
        number of failing tests. This may happen for several reasons, but the
        most likely cause is that the host system does not have the
        <code class="systemitem">devpts</code> file system set up correctly.
        This issue is discussed in greater detail at <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/faq.html#no-ptys">https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/faq.html#no-ptys</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes package test suites will fail for reasons which the
        developers are aware of and have deemed non-critical. Consult the
        logs located at <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/build-logs/12.2/">https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/build-logs/12.2/</a>
        to verify whether or not these failures are expected. This site is
        valid for all test suites throughout this book.

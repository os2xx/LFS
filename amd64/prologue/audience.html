      <p>
        There are many reasons why you would want to read this book. One of
        the questions many people raise is, <span class="quote">“<span class=
        "quote">why go through all the hassle of manually building a Linux
        system from scratch when you can just download and install an
        existing one?</span>”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        One important reason for this project's existence is to help you
        learn how a Linux system works from the inside out. Building an LFS
        system helps demonstrate what makes Linux tick, and how things work
        together and depend on each other. One of the best things this
        learning experience can provide is the ability to customize a Linux
        system to suit your own unique needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another key benefit of LFS is that it gives you control of the system
        without relying on someone else's Linux implementation. With LFS, you
        are in the driver's seat. <span class="emphasis"><em>You</em></span>
        dictate every aspect of your system.
      </p>
      <p>
        LFS allows you to create very compact Linux systems. With other
        distributions you are often forced to install a great many programs
        you neither use nor understand. These programs waste resources. You
        may argue that with today's hard drives and CPUs, wasted resources
        are no longer a consideration. Sometimes, however, you are still
        constrained by the system's size, if nothing else. Think about
        bootable CDs, USB sticks, and embedded systems. Those are areas where
        LFS can be beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another advantage of a custom built Linux system is security. By
        compiling the entire system from source code, you are empowered to
        audit everything and apply all the security patches you want. You
        don't have to wait for somebody else to compile binary packages that
        fix a security hole. Unless you examine the patch and implement it
        yourself, you have no guarantee that the new binary package was built
        correctly and adequately fixes the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of Linux From Scratch is to build a complete and usable
        foundation-level system. If you do not wish to build your own Linux
        system from scratch, you may nevertheless benefit from the
        information in this book.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are too many good reasons to build your own LFS system to list
        them all here. In the end, education is by far the most important
        reason. As you continue your LFS experience, you will discover the
        power that information and knowledge can bring.

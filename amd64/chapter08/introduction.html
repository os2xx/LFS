      Introduction
    </h1>
    <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
      <p>
        In this chapter, we start constructing the LFS system in earnest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The installation of this software is straightforward. Although in
        many cases the installation instructions could be made shorter and
        more generic, we have opted to provide the full instructions for
        every package to minimize the possibilities for mistakes. The key to
        learning what makes a Linux system work is to know what each package
        is used for and why you (or the system) may need it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not recommend using customized optimizations. They can make a
        program run slightly faster, but they may also cause compilation
        difficulties, and problems when running the program. If a package
        refuses to compile with a customized optimization, try to compile it
        without optimization and see if that fixes the problem. Even if the
        package does compile when using a customized optimization, there is
        the risk it may have been compiled incorrectly because of the complex
        interactions between the code and the build tools. Also note that the
        <code class="option">-march</code> and <code class=
        "option">-mtune</code> options using values not specified in the book
        have not been tested. This may cause problems with the toolchain
        packages (Binutils, GCC and Glibc). The small potential gains
        achieved by customizing compiler optimizations are often outweighed
        by the risks. First-time builders of LFS are encouraged to build
        without custom optimizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, we keep the optimizations enabled by the default
        configuration of the packages. In addition, we sometimes explicitly
        enable an optimized configuration provided by a package but not
        enabled by default. The package maintainers have already tested these
        configurations and consider them safe, so it's not likely they would
        break the build. Generally the default configuration already enables
        <code class="option">-O2</code> or <code class="option">-O3</code>,
        so the resulting system will still run very fast without any
        customized optimization, and be stable at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the installation instructions, each installation page provides
        information about the package, including a concise description of
        what it contains, approximately how long it will take to build, and
        how much disk space is required during this building process.
        Following the installation instructions, there is a list of programs
        and libraries (along with brief descriptions) that the package
        installs.

          8.1.1. About Libraries
        </h2>
        <p>
          In general, the LFS editors discourage building and installing
          static libraries. Most static libraries have been made obsolete in
          a modern Linux system. In addition, linking a static library into a
          program can be detrimental. If an update to the library is needed
          to remove a security problem, every program that uses the static
          library will need to be relinked with the new library. Since the
          use of static libraries is not always obvious, the relevant
          programs (and the procedures needed to do the linking) may not even
          be known.
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedures in this chapter remove or disable installation of
          most static libraries. Usually this is done by passing a
          <code class="option">--disable-static</code> option to <span class=
          "command"><strong>configure</strong></span>. In other cases,
          alternate means are needed. In a few cases, especially Glibc and
          GCC, the use of static libraries remains an essential feature of
          the package building process.

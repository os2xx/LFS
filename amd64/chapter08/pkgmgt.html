      <p>
        Package Management is an often requested addition to the LFS Book. A
        Package Manager tracks the installation of files, making it easier to
        remove and upgrade packages. A good package manager will also handle
        the configuration files specially to keep the user configuration when
        the package is reinstalled or upgraded. Before you begin to wonder,
        NO—this section will not talk about nor recommend any particular
        package manager. What it does provide is a roundup of the more
        popular techniques and how they work. The perfect package manager for
        you may be among these techniques, or it may be a combination of two
        or more of these techniques. This section briefly mentions issues
        that may arise when upgrading packages.

        Some reasons why no package manager is mentioned in LFS or BLFS

        </h2>
        <p>
          A Package Manager makes it easy to upgrade to newer versions when
          they are released. Generally the instructions in the LFS and BLFS
          books can be used to upgrade to the newer versions. Here are some
          points that you should be aware of when upgrading packages,
          especially on a running system.

              <p>
                If the Linux kernel needs to be upgraded (for example, from
                5.10.17 to 5.10.18 or 5.11.1), nothing else needs to be
                rebuilt. The system will keep working fine thanks to the
                well-defined interface between the kernel and userspace.
                Specifically, Linux API headers need not be upgraded along
                with the kernel. You will merely need to reboot your system
                to use the upgraded kernel.

                If a package containing a shared library is updated, and if
                the name of the library changes, then any packages
                dynamically linked to the library must be recompiled, to link
                against the newer library. (Note that there is no correlation
                between the package version and the name of the library.) For
                example, consider a package foo-1.2.3 that installs a shared
                library with the name <code class=
                "filename">libfoo.so.1</code>. Suppose you upgrade the
                package to a newer version foo-1.2.4 that installs a shared

                against <code class="filename">libfoo.so.2</code> in order to
                use the new library version. You should not remove the old
                libraries until all the dependent packages have been
                recompiled.

                shared library without causing the process to crash is to
                remove it first, then install the new version. The
                <span class="command"><strong>install</strong></span> command
                provided by <span class="application">coreutils</span> has
                already implemented this, and most packages use that command
                to install binary files and libraries. This means that you
                won't be troubled by this issue most of the time. However,
                the install process of some packages (notably SpiderMonkey in
                BLFS) just overwrites the file if it exists; this causes a
                crash. So it's safer to save your work and close unneeded
                running processes before updating a package.

          8.2.2. Package Management Techniques
        </h2>
        <p>
          The following are some common package management techniques. Before
          making a decision on a package manager, do some research on the
          various techniques, particularly the drawbacks of each particular
          scheme.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Yes, this is a package management technique. Some folks do not
            need a package manager because they know the packages intimately
            and know which files are installed by each package. Some users
            also do not need any package management because they plan on
            rebuilding the entire system whenever a package is changed.

            8.2.2.2. Install in Separate Directories
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is a simplistic package management technique that does not
            need a special program to manage the packages. Each package is
            installed in a separate directory. For example, package foo-1.1
            is installed in <code class="filename">/opt/foo-1.1</code> and a
            symlink is made from <code class="filename">/opt/foo</code> to
            <code class="filename">/opt/foo-1.1</code>. When a new version
            foo-1.2 comes along, it is installed in <code class=
            "filename">/opt/foo-1.2</code> and the previous symlink is
            replaced by a symlink to the new version.
          </p>
          <p>
            Environment variables such as <code class="envar">PATH</code>,
            <code class="envar">MANPATH</code>, <code class=
            "envar">INFOPATH</code>, <code class=
            "envar">PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code>, <code class=
            "envar">CPPFLAGS</code>, <code class="envar">LDFLAGS</code>, and
            the configuration file <code class=
            "filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code> may need to be expanded to
            include the corresponding subdirectories in <code class=
            "filename">/opt/foo-x.y</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This scheme is used by the BLFS book to install some very large
            packages to make it easier to upgrade them. If you install more
            than a few packages, this scheme becomes unmanageable. And some
            packages (for example Linux API headers and Glibc) may not work
            well with this scheme. <span class="bold"><strong>Never use this
            scheme system-wide.</strong></span>

            8.2.2.3. Symlink Style Package Management
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is a variation of the previous package management technique.
            Each package is installed as in the previous scheme. But instead
            of making the symlink via a generic package name, each file is
            symlinked into the <code class="filename">/usr</code> hierarchy.
            This removes the need to expand the environment variables. Though
            the symlinks can be created by the user, many package managers
            use this approach, and automate the creation of the symlinks. A
            few of the popular ones include Stow, Epkg, Graft, and Depot.
          </p>
          <p>
            The installation script needs to be fooled, so the package thinks
            it is installed in <code class="filename">/usr</code> though in
            reality it is installed in the <code class=
            "filename">/usr/pkg</code> hierarchy. Installing in this manner
            is not usually a trivial task. For example, suppose you are
            installing a package libfoo-1.1. The following instructions may
            not install the package properly:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1
make
make install</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            The installation will work, but the dependent packages may not
            link to libfoo as you would expect. If you compile a package that
            links against libfoo, you may notice that it is linked to
            <code class="filename">/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1/lib/libfoo.so.1</code>
            instead of <code class="filename">/usr/lib/libfoo.so.1</code> as
            you would expect. The correct approach is to use the <code class=
            "envar">DESTDIR</code> variable to direct the installation. This
            approach works as follows:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make DESTDIR=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1 install</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            Most packages support this approach, but there are some which do
            not. For the non-compliant packages, you may either need to
            install the package manually, or you may find that it is easier
            to install some problematic packages into <code class=
            "filename">/opt</code>.

            8.2.2.4. Timestamp Based
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this technique, a file is timestamped before the installation
            of the package. After the installation, a simple use of the
            <span class="command"><strong>find</strong></span> command with
            the appropriate options can generate a log of all the files
            installed after the timestamp file was created. A package manager
            that uses this approach is install-log.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though this scheme has the advantage of being simple, it has two
            drawbacks. If, during installation, the files are installed with
            any timestamp other than the current time, those files will not
            be tracked by the package manager. Also, this scheme can only be
            used when packages are installed one at a time. The logs are not
            reliable if two packages are installed simultaneously from two
            different consoles.

            perform are recorded. There are two techniques that one can use:
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code class="envar">LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable
            can be set to point to a library to be preloaded before
            installation. During installation, this library tracks the
            packages that are being installed by attaching itself to various
            executables such as <span class=
            "command"><strong>cp</strong></span>, <span class=
            "command"><strong>install</strong></span>, <span class=
            "command"><strong>mv</strong></span> and tracking the system
            calls that modify the filesystem. For this approach to work, all
            the executables need to be dynamically linked without the suid or
            sgid bit. Preloading the library may cause some unwanted
            side-effects during installation. Therefore, it's a good idea to
            perform some tests to ensure that the package manager does not
            break anything, and that it logs all the appropriate files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another technique is to use <span class=
            "command"><strong>strace</strong></span>, which logs all the
            system calls made during the execution of the installation
            scripts.

            8.2.2.6. Creating Package Archives
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this scheme, the package installation is faked into a separate
            tree as previously described in the symlink style package
            management section. After the installation, a package archive is
            created using the installed files. This archive is then used to
            install the package on the local machine or even on other
            machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach is used by most of the package managers found in
            the commercial distributions. Examples of package managers that
            follow this approach are RPM (which, incidentally, is required by
            the <a class="ulink" href=
            "https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml">Linux Standard
            Base Specification</a>), pkg-utils, Debian's apt, and Gentoo's
            Portage system. A hint describing how to adopt this style of
            package management for LFS systems is located at <a class="ulink"

          </p>
          <p>
            The creation of package files that include dependency information
            is complex, and beyond the scope of LFS.

            Slackware uses a <span class=
            "command"><strong>tar</strong></span>-based system for package
            archives. This system purposely does not handle package
            dependencies as more complex package managers do. For details of
            Slackware package management, see <a class="ulink" href=

          </h3>
          <p>
            This scheme, unique to LFS, was devised by Matthias Benkmann, and
            is available from the <a class="ulink" href=
            "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/">Hints
            Project</a>. In this scheme, each package is installed as a
            separate user into the standard locations. Files belonging to a
            package are easily identified by checking the user ID. The
            features and shortcomings of this approach are too complex to
            describe in this section. For the details please see the hint at

          8.2.3. Deploying LFS on Multiple Systems
        </h2>
        <p>
          One of the advantages of an LFS system is that there are no files
          that depend on the position of files on a disk system. Cloning an
          LFS build to another computer with the same architecture as the
          base system is as simple as using <span class=
          "command"><strong>tar</strong></span> on the LFS partition that
          contains the root directory (about 900MB uncompressed for a basic
          LFS build), copying that file via network transfer or CD-ROM / USB
          stick to the new system, and expanding it. After that, a few
          configuration files will have to be changed. Configuration files
          that may need to be updated include: <code class=
          "filename">/etc/hosts</code>, <code class=
          "filename">/etc/fstab</code>, <code class=
          "filename">/etc/passwd</code>, <code class=
          "filename">/etc/group</code>, <span class="phrase"><code class=
          "filename">/etc/shadow</code>, <code class=
          "filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</code>, <code class=
          "filename">/etc/sysconfig/rc.site</code>, <code class=
          "filename">/etc/sysconfig/network</code>, and <code class=
          "filename">/etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0</code>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          A custom kernel may be needed for the new system, depending on
          differences in system hardware and the original kernel
          configuration.

          <p>
            There have been some reports of issues when copying between
            similar but not identical architectures. For instance, the
            instruction set for an Intel system is not identical with the AMD
            processor's instructions, and later versions of some processors
            may provide instructions that are unavailable with earlier
            versions.

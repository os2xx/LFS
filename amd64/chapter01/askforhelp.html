          Note
        </h3>
        <p>
          In case you've hit an issue building one package with the LFS
          instruction, we strongly discourage posting the issue directly onto
          the upstream support channel before discussing via a LFS support
          channel listed in <a class="xref" href="resources.html" title=
          "1.4.&nbsp;Resources">Section&nbsp;1.4, “Resources.”</a> Doing so
          is often quite inefficient because the upstream maintainers are
          rarely familiar with LFS building procedure. Even if you've really
          hit an upstream issue, the LFS community can still help to isolate
          the information wanted by the upstream maintainers and make a
          proper report.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you must ask a question directly via an upstream support
          channel, you shall at least note that many upstream projects have
          the support channels separated from the bug tracker. The
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bug</span>”</span> reports
          for asking questions are considered invalid and may annoy upstream
          developers for these projects.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        If an issue or a question is encountered while working through this
        book, please check the FAQ page at <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq/#generalfaq">https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq/#generalfaq</a>.
        Questions are often already answered there. If your question is not
        answered on that page, try to find the source of the problem. The
        following hint will give you some guidance for troubleshooting:

      </p>
      <p>
        If you cannot find your problem listed in the FAQ, search the mailing
        lists at <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html">https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have a wonderful LFS community that is willing to offer
        assistance through the mailing lists and IRC (see the <a class="xref"
        href="resources.html" title="1.4.&nbsp;Resources">Section&nbsp;1.4,
        “Resources”</a> section of this book). However, we get several
        support questions every day, and many of them could have been easily
        answered by going to the FAQ or by searching the mailing lists first.
        So, for us to offer the best assistance possible, you should first do
        some research on your own. That allows us to focus on the more
        unusual support needs. If your searches do not produce a solution,
        please include all the relevant information (mentioned below) in your
        request for help.

            Deviating from this book does <span class=

            After all, LFS is about personal preference. Being up-front about
            any changes to the established procedure helps us evaluate and
            determine possible causes of your problem.

          1.5.2. Configure Script Problems

        <p>
          If something goes wrong while running the <span class=
          "command"><strong>configure</strong></span> script, review the
          <code class="filename">config.log</code> file. This file may
          contain errors encountered during <span class=
          "command"><strong>configure</strong></span> which were not printed
          to the screen. Include the <span class=

          help.

          1.5.3. Compilation Problems
        </h2>
        <p>
          Both the screen output and the contents of various files are useful
          in determining the cause of compilation problems. The screen output
          from the <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span>
          script and the <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span>
          run can be helpful. It is not necessary to include the entire
          output, but do include all of the relevant information. Here is an
          example of the type of information to include from the <span class=
          "command"><strong>make</strong></span> screen output.
        </p>
        <pre class="screen"><code class=
        "computeroutput">gcc -D ALIASPATH=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/share/locale:.\"
-D LOCALEDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/share/locale\"
-D LIBDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/lib\"
-D INCLUDEDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/include\" -D HAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.
-g -O2 -c getopt1.c
gcc -g -O2 -static -o make ar.o arscan.o commands.o dir.o
expand.o file.o function.o getopt.o implicit.o job.o main.o
misc.o read.o remake.o rule.o signame.o variable.o vpath.o
default.o remote-stub.o version.o opt1.o
-lutil job.o: In function `load_too_high':
/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1/job.c:1565: undefined reference
to `getloadavg'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [make] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2</code></pre>
        <p>
          In this case, many people would just include the bottom section:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen"><code class=
        "computeroutput">make [2]: *** [make] Error 1</code></pre>
        <p>
          This is not enough information to diagnose the problem, because it
          only notes that something went wrong, not <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>what</em></span> went wrong. The entire section, as
          in the example above, is what should be saved because it includes
          the command that was executed and all the associated error
          messages.

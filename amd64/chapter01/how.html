      <p>
        The LFS system will be built by using an already installed Linux
        distribution (such as Debian, OpenMandriva, Fedora, or openSUSE).
        This existing Linux system (the host) will be used as a starting
        point to provide necessary programs, including a compiler, linker,
        and shell, to build the new system. Select the <span class=
        "quote">“<span class="quote">development</span>”</span> option during
        the distribution installation to include these tools.

          Note
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are many ways to install a Linux distribution and the
          defaults are usually not optimal for building an LFS system. For
          suggestions on setting up a commercial distribution see: <a class=
          "ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/partitioning-for-lfs.txt">
          https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/partitioning-for-lfs.txt</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        As an alternative to installing a separate distribution on your
        machine, you may wish to use a LiveCD from a commercial distribution.

        <a class="xref" href="../chapter02/chapter02.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Preparing the Host System">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>
        of this book describes how to create a new Linux native partition and
        file system, where the new LFS system will be compiled and installed.
        <a class="xref" href="../chapter03/chapter03.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Packages and Patches">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>
        explains which packages and patches must be downloaded to build an
        LFS system, and how to store them on the new file system. <a class=
        "xref" href="../chapter04/chapter04.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Final Preparations">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>
        discusses the setup of an appropriate working environment. Please
        read <a class="xref" href="../chapter04/chapter04.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Final Preparations">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>
        carefully as it explains several important issues you should be aware
        of before you begin to work your way through <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Compiling a Cross-Toolchain">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>
        and beyond.

      <p>
        <a class="xref" href="../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Compiling a Cross-Toolchain">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>
        explains the installation of the initial tool chain, (binutils, gcc,
        and glibc) using cross-compilation techniques to isolate the new
        tools from the host system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Cross Compiling Temporary Tools">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>
        shows you how to cross-compile basic utilities using the just built
        cross-toolchain.

      <p>
        <a class="xref" href="../chapter07/chapter07.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Entering Chroot and Building Additional Temporary Tools">
        Chapter&nbsp;7</a> then enters a "chroot" environment, where we use
        the new tools to build all the rest of the tools needed to create the
        LFS system.
      </p>
      <p>
        This effort to isolate the new system from the host distribution may
        seem excessive. A full technical explanation as to why this is done
        is provided in <a class="xref" href=
        "../partintro/toolchaintechnotes.html" title=
        "Toolchain Technical Notes">Toolchain Technical Notes</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a class="xref" href="../chapter08/chapter08.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>
        the full-blown LFS system is built. Another advantage provided by the
        chroot environment is that it allows you to continue using the host
        system while LFS is being built. While waiting for package
        compilations to complete, you can continue using your computer as
        usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish the installation, the basic system configuration is set up
        in <a class="xref" href="../chapter09/chapter09.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;9.&nbsp;System Configuration">Chapter&nbsp;9</a>, and
        the kernel and boot loader are created in <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter10/chapter10.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Making the LFS System Bootable">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>.
        <a class="xref" href="../chapter11/chapter11.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;11.&nbsp;The End">Chapter&nbsp;11</a> contains
        information on continuing the LFS experience beyond this book. After
        the steps in this chapter have been implemented, the computer is
        ready to boot into the new LFS system.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the process in a nutshell. Detailed information on each step
        is presented in the following chapters. Items that seem complicated
        now will be clarified, and everything will fall into place as you
        commence your LFS adventure.

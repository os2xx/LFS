          11.5.1. Deciding what to do next
        </h2>
        <p>
          Now that LFS is complete and you have a bootable system, what do
          you do? The next step is to decide how to use it. Generally, there
          are two broad categories to consider: workstation or server.
          Indeed, these categories are not mutually exclusive. The
          applications needed for each category can be combined onto a single
          system, but let's look at them separately for now.
        </p>
        <p>
          A server is the simpler category. Generally this consists of a web
          server such as the <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/server/apache.html">
          Apache HTTP Server</a> and a database server such as <a class=
          "ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/server/mariadb.html">
          MariaDB</a>. However other services are possible. The operating
          system embedded in a single use device falls into this category.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, a workstation is much more complex. It generally
          requires a graphical user environment such as <a class="ulink"
          href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/lxde/lxde.html">
          LXDE</a>, <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/xfce/xfce.html">
          XFCE</a>, <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/kde/kde.html">
          KDE</a>, or <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/gnome/gnome.html">
          Gnome</a> based on a basic <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/x/installing.html">
          graphical environment</a> and several graphical based applications
          such as the <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/xsoft/firefox.html">
          Firefox web browser</a>, <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/xsoft/thunderbird.html">
          Thunderbird email client</a>, or <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/xsoft/libreoffice.html">
          LibreOffice office suite</a>. These applications require many
          (several hundred depending on desired capabilities) more packages
          of support applications and libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the above, there is a set of applications for system
          management for all kinds of systems. These applications are all in
          the BLFS book. Not all packages are needed in every environments.
          For example <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/basicnet/dhcpcd.html">
          dhcpcd</a>, is not normally appropriate for a server and <a class=
          "ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/basicnet/wireless_tools.html">
          wireless_tools</a>, are normally only useful for a laptop system.

          11.5.2. Working in a basic LFS environment
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you initially boot into LFS, you have all the internal tools
          to build additional packages. Unfortunately, the user environment
          is quite sparse. There are a couple of ways to improve this:
        </p>
        <div class="sect3">
          <h3 class="sect3">
            11.5.2.1. Work from the LFS host in chroot
          </h3>
          <p>
            This method provides a complete graphical environment where a
            full featured browser and copy/paste capabilities are available.
            This method allows using applications like the host's version of
            wget to download package sources to a location available when
            working in the chroot environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to properly build packages in chroot, you will also need
            to remember to mount the virtual file systems if they are not
            already mounted. One way to do this is to create a script on the
            <span class="bold"><strong>HOST</strong></span> system:
          </p>
          <pre class="screen"><span class=
          "command"><strong>cat &gt; ~/mount-virt.sh &lt;&lt; "EOF"
#!/bin/bash

function mountbind
{
   if ! mountpoint $LFS/$1 &gt;/dev/null; then
     $SUDO mount --bind /$1 $LFS/$1
     echo $LFS/$1 mounted
   else
     echo $LFS/$1 already mounted
   fi
}

function mounttype
{
   if ! mountpoint $LFS/$1 &gt;/dev/null; then
     $SUDO mount -t $2 $3 $4 $5 $LFS/$1
     echo $LFS/$1 mounted
   else
     echo $LFS/$1 already mounted
   fi
}

if [ $EUID -ne 0 ]; then
  SUDO=sudo
else
  SUDO=""
fi

if [ x$LFS == x ]; then
  echo "LFS not set"
  exit 1
fi

mountbind dev
mounttype dev/pts devpts devpts -o gid=5,mode=620
mounttype proc    proc   proc
mounttype sys     sysfs  sysfs
mounttype run     tmpfs  run
if [ -h $LFS/dev/shm ]; then
  install -v -d -m 1777 $LFS$(realpath /dev/shm)
else
  mounttype dev/shm tmpfs tmpfs -o nosuid,nodev
fi 

#mountbind usr/src
#mountbind boot
#mountbind home
EOF</strong></span></pre>
          <p>
            Note that the last three commands in the script are commented
            out. These are useful if those directories are mounted as
            separate partitions on the host system and will be mounted when
            booting the completed LFS/BLFS system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The script can be run with <span class="command"><strong>bash
            ~/mount-virt.sh</strong></span> as either a regular user
            (recommended) or as <code class="systemitem">root</code>. If run
            as a regular user, sudo is required on the host system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another issue pointed out by the script is where to store
            downloaded package files. This location is arbitrary. It can be
            in a regular user's home directory such as ~/sources or in a
            global location like /usr/src. Our recommendation is not to mix
            BLFS sources and LFS sources in (from the chroot environment)
            /sources. In any case, the packages must be accessible inside the
            chroot environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            A last convenience feature presented here is to streamline the
            process of entering the chroot environment. This can be done with
            an alias placed in a user's ~/.bashrc file on the host system:
          </p>
          <pre class="screen"><span class=
          "command"><strong>alias lfs='sudo /usr/sbin/chroot /mnt/lfs /usr/bin/env -i HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1="\u:\w\\\\$ "
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin /bin/bash --login'</strong></span></pre>
          <p>
            This alias is a little tricky because of the quoting and levels
            of backslash characters. It must be all on a single line. The
            above command has been split in two for presentation purposes.

            11.5.2.2. Work remotely via ssh
          </h3>
          <p>
            This method also provides a full graphical environment, but first
            requires installing <a class="ulink" href=
            "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable-systemd/postlfs/openssh.html">
            sshd</a> on the LFS system, usually in chroot. It also requires a
            second computer. This method has the advantage of being simple by
            not requiring the complexity of the chroot environment. It also
            uses your LFS built kernel for all additional packages and still
            provides a complete system for installing packages.

          <p>
            You may use the <span class="command"><strong>scp</strong></span>
            command to upload the package sources to be built onto the LFS
            system. If you want to download the sources onto the LFS system
            directly instead, install <a class="ulink" href=

            links</a> (or <a class="ulink" href=

            lynx</a>) in chroot and then rebooting into the new LFS system.
            At this point the default system has six virtual consoles.
            Switching consoles is as easy as using the <span class=
            "keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class=
            "keycap"><strong>Fx</strong></span> key combinations where
            <span class="keycap"><strong>Fx</strong></span> is between
            <span class="keycap"><strong>F1</strong></span> and <span class=
            "keycap"><strong>F6</strong></span>. The <span class=
            "keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class=
            "keycap"><strong>←</strong></span> and <span class=
            "keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class=
            "keycap"><strong>→</strong></span> combinations also will change
            the console.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point you can log into two different virtual consoles and
            run the links or lynx browser in one console and bash in the
            other. GPM then allows copying commands from the browser with the
            left mouse button, switching consoles, and pasting into the other
            console.

              As a side note, switching of virtual consoles can also be done
              from an X Window instance with the <span class=

              "keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class=

              mouse copy operation does not work between the graphical
              interface and a virtual console. You can return to the X Window
              display with the <span class=
              "keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class=
              "keycap"><strong>Alt</strong></span>+<span class=
              "keycap"><strong>Fx</strong></span> combination, where

        In <a class="xref" href="../chapter08/chapter08.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>,
        we installed the udev daemon when <span class="phrase">systemd</span>
        was built. Before we go into the details regarding how udev works, a
        brief history of previous methods of handling devices is in order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linux systems in general traditionally used a static device creation
        method, whereby a great many device nodes were created under
        <code class="filename">/dev</code> (sometimes literally thousands of
        nodes), regardless of whether the corresponding hardware devices
        actually existed. This was typically done via a <span class=
        "command"><strong>MAKEDEV</strong></span> script, which contained a
        number of calls to the <span class=
        "command"><strong>mknod</strong></span> program with the relevant
        major and minor device numbers for every possible device that might
        exist in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the udev method, device nodes are only created for those
        devices which are detected by the kernel. These device nodes are
        created each time the system boots; they are stored in a <code class=
        "systemitem">devtmpfs</code> file system (a virtual file system that
        resides entirely in system memory). Device nodes do not require much
        space, so the memory that is used is negligible.
      </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <h2 class="sect2">
          9.3.1. History
        </h2>
        <p>
          In February 2000, a new filesystem called <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code> was merged into the 2.3.46 kernel and was
          made available during the 2.4 series of stable kernels. Although it
          was present in the kernel source itself, this method of creating
          devices dynamically never received overwhelming support from the
          core kernel developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main problem with the approach adopted by <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code> was the way it handled device detection,
          creation, and naming. The latter issue, that of device node naming,
          was perhaps the most critical. It is generally accepted that if
          device names are configurable, the device naming policy should be
          chosen by system administrators, and not imposed on them by the
          developer(s). The <code class="systemitem">devfs</code> file system
          also suffered from race conditions that were inherent in its
          design; these could not be fixed without a substantial revision of
          the kernel. <code class="systemitem">devfs</code> was marked as
          deprecated for a long time, and was finally removed from the kernel
          in June, 2006.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the development of the unstable 2.5 kernel tree, later
          released as the 2.6 series of stable kernels, a new virtual
          filesystem called <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> came to be.
          The job of <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> is to provide
          information about the system's hardware configuration to userspace
          processes. With this userspace-visible representation, it became
          possible to develop a userspace replacement for <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code>.

          <p>
            The <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> filesystem was
            mentioned briefly above. One may wonder how <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code> knows about the devices present on a
            system and what device numbers should be used for them. Drivers
            that have been compiled into the kernel register their objects in
            <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> (devtmpfs internally) as
            they are detected by the kernel. For drivers compiled as modules,
            registration happens when the module is loaded. Once the
            <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> filesystem is mounted (on
            <code class="filename">/sys</code>), data which the drivers have
            registered with <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> are
            available to userspace processes and to udevd for processing
            (including modifications to device nodes).

            Creation
          </h3>
          <p>
            Device files are created by the kernel in the <code class=
            "systemitem">devtmpfs</code> file system. Any driver that wishes
            to register a device node will use the <code class=
            "systemitem">devtmpfs</code> (via the driver core) to do it. When
            a <code class="systemitem">devtmpfs</code> instance is mounted on
            <code class="filename">/dev</code>, the device node will
            initially be exposed to userspace with a fixed name, permissions,
            and owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            A short time later, the kernel will send a uevent to <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span>. Based on the rules
            specified in the files within the <code class=
            "filename">/etc/udev/rules.d</code>, <code class=
            "filename">/usr/lib/udev/rules.d</code>, and <code class=
            "filename">/run/udev/rules.d</code> directories, <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> will create additional
            symlinks to the device node, or change its permissions, owner, or
            group, or modify the internal <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> database entry (name) for
            that object.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rules in these three directories are numbered and all three
            directories are merged together. If <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> can't find a rule for the
            device it is creating, it will leave the permissions and
            ownership at whatever <code class="systemitem">devtmpfs</code>
            used initially.

            Loading
          </h3>
          <p>
            Device drivers compiled as modules may have aliases built into
            them. Aliases are visible in the output of the <span class=
            "command"><strong>modinfo</strong></span> program and are usually
            related to the bus-specific identifiers of devices supported by a
            module. For example, the <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>snd-fm801</em></span> driver supports PCI devices
            with vendor ID 0x1319 and device ID 0x0801, and has an alias of
            <code class=
            "literal">pci:v00001319d00000801sv*sd*bc04sc01i*</code>. For most
            devices, the bus driver exports the alias of the driver that
            would handle the device via <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code>. E.g., the <code class=
            "filename">/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:0d.0/modalias</code> file
            might contain the string <code class=
            "literal">pci:v00001319d00000801sv00001319sd00001319bc04sc01i00</code>.
            The default rules provided with udev will cause <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> to call out to
            <span class="command"><strong>/sbin/modprobe</strong></span> with
            the contents of the <code class="envar">MODALIAS</code> uevent
            environment variable (which should be the same as the contents of
            the <code class="filename">modalias</code> file in sysfs), thus
            loading all modules whose aliases match this string after
            wildcard expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example, this means that, in addition to <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>snd-fm801</em></span>, the obsolete (and unwanted)
            <span class="emphasis"><em>forte</em></span> driver will be
            loaded if it is available. See below for ways in which the
            loading of unwanted drivers can be prevented.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kernel itself is also able to load modules for network
            protocols, filesystems, and NLS support on demand.

          9.3.3. Problems with Loading Modules and Creating Devices
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are a few possible problems when it comes to automatically
          creating device nodes.

            9.3.3.1. A Kernel Module Is Not Loaded Automatically
          </h3>
          <p>
            Udev will only load a module if it has a bus-specific alias and
            the bus driver properly exports the necessary aliases to
            <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>. In other cases, one should
            arrange module loading by other means. With Linux-6.7.4, udev is
            known to load properly-written drivers for INPUT, IDE, PCI, USB,
            SCSI, SERIO, and FireWire devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine if the device driver you require has the necessary
            support for udev, run <span class=
            "command"><strong>modinfo</strong></span> with the module name as
            the argument. Now try locating the device directory under
            <code class="filename">/sys/bus</code> and check whether there is
            a <code class="filename">modalias</code> file there.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <code class="filename">modalias</code> file exists in
            <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>, the driver supports the
            device and can talk to it directly, but doesn't have the alias,
            it is a bug in the driver. Load the driver without the help from
            udev and expect the issue to be fixed later.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is no <code class="filename">modalias</code> file in the
            relevant directory under <code class="filename">/sys/bus</code>,
            this means that the kernel developers have not yet added modalias
            support to this bus type. With Linux-6.7.4, this is the case with
            ISA busses. Expect this issue to be fixed in later kernel
            versions.

            <span class="command"><strong>modprobe</strong></span> to load

          <p>
            First, be certain that the driver is built into the kernel or
            already loaded as a module, and that udev isn't creating a
            misnamed device.

          <p>
            If a kernel driver does not export its data to <code class=

            create a device node. This is most likely to happen with third
            party drivers from outside the kernel tree. Create a static

          <p>
            This is due to the fact that udev, by design, handles uevents and
            loads modules in parallel, and thus in an unpredictable order.
            This will never be <span class="quote">“<span class=
            "quote">fixed.</span>”</span> You should not rely upon the kernel
            device names being stable. Instead, create your own rules that
            make symlinks with stable names based on some stable attributes
            of the device, such as a serial number or the output of various
            *_id utilities installed by udev. See <a class="xref" href=

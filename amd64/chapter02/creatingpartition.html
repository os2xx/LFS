    </h1>
    <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
      <p>
        Like most other operating systems, LFS is usually installed on a
        dedicated partition. The recommended approach to building an LFS
        system is to use an available empty partition or, if you have enough
        unpartitioned space, to create one.
      </p>
      <p>
        A minimal system requires a partition of around 10 gigabytes (GB).
        This is enough to store all the source tarballs and compile the
        packages. However, if the LFS system is intended to be the primary
        Linux system, additional software will probably be installed which
        will require additional space. A 30 GB partition is a reasonable size
        to provide for growth. The LFS system itself will not take up this
        much room. A large portion of this requirement is to provide
        sufficient free temporary storage as well as for adding additional
        capabilities after LFS is complete. Additionally, compiling packages
        can require a lot of disk space which will be reclaimed after the
        package is installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because there is not always enough Random Access Memory (RAM)
        available for compilation processes, it is a good idea to use a small
        disk partition as <code class="systemitem">swap</code> space. This is
        used by the kernel to store seldom-used data and leave more memory
        available for active processes. The <code class=
        "systemitem">swap</code> partition for an LFS system can be the same
        as the one used by the host system, in which case it is not necessary
        to create another one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start a disk partitioning program such as <span class=
        "command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> or <span class=
        "command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> with a command line option
        naming the hard disk on which the new partition will be created—for
        example <code class="filename">/dev/sda</code> for the primary disk
        drive. Create a Linux native partition and a <code class=
        "systemitem">swap</code> partition, if needed. Please refer to
        <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://man.archlinux.org/man/cfdisk.8">cfdisk(8)</a> or <a class=
        "ulink" href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> if
        you do not yet know how to use the programs.

        <p>
          For experienced users, other partitioning schemes are possible. The
          new LFS system can be on a software <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/12.2/postlfs/raid.html">
          RAID</a> array or an <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/12.2/postlfs/aboutlvm.html">
          LVM</a> logical volume. However, some of these options require an
          <a class="ulink" href=
          "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/12.2/postlfs/initramfs.html">
          initramfs</a>, which is an advanced topic. These partitioning
          methodologies are not recommended for first time LFS users.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Remember the designation of the new partition (e.g., <code class=
        "filename">sda5</code>). This book will refer to this as the LFS
        partition. Also remember the designation of the <code class=
        "systemitem">swap</code> partition. These names will be needed later
        for the <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file.

          2.4.1. Other Partition Issues
        </h2>
        <p>
          Requests for advice on system partitioning are often posted on the
          LFS mailing lists. This is a highly subjective topic. The default
          for most distributions is to use the entire drive with the
          exception of one small swap partition. This is not optimal for LFS
          for several reasons. It reduces flexibility, makes sharing of data
          across multiple distributions or LFS builds more difficult, makes
          backups more time consuming, and can waste disk space through
          inefficient allocation of file system structures.

            2.4.1.1. The Root Partition
          </h3>
          <p>
            A root LFS partition (not to be confused with the <code class=
            "filename">/root</code> directory) of twenty gigabytes is a good
            compromise for most systems. It provides enough space to build
            LFS and most of BLFS, but is small enough so that multiple
            partitions can be easily created for experimentation.

            2.4.1.2. The Swap Partition
          </h3>
          <p>
            Most distributions automatically create a swap partition.
            Generally the recommended size of the swap partition is about
            twice the amount of physical RAM, however this is rarely needed.
            If disk space is limited, hold the swap partition to two
            gigabytes and monitor the amount of disk swapping.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to use the hibernation feature (suspend-to-disk) of
            Linux, it writes out the contents of RAM to the swap partition
            before turning off the machine. In this case the size of the swap
            partition should be at least as large as the system's installed
            RAM.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swapping is never good. For mechanical hard drives you can
            generally tell if a system is swapping by just listening to disk
            activity and observing how the system reacts to commands. With an
            SSD you will not be able to hear swapping, but you can tell how
            much swap space is being used by running the <span class=
            "command"><strong>top</strong></span> or <span class=
            "command"><strong>free</strong></span> programs. Use of an SSD
            for a swap partition should be avoided if possible. The first
            reaction to swapping should be to check for an unreasonable
            command such as trying to edit a five gigabyte file. If swapping
            becomes a normal occurrence, the best solution is to purchase
            more RAM for your system.

            2.4.1.3. The Grub Bios Partition

            If the <span class="emphasis"><em>boot disk</em></span> has been
            partitioned with a GUID Partition Table (GPT), then a small,
            typically 1 MB, partition must be created if it does not already
            exist. This partition is not formatted, but must be available for
            GRUB to use during installation of the boot loader. This
            partition will normally be labeled 'BIOS Boot' if using
            <span class="command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> or have a
            code of <span class="emphasis"><em>EF02</em></span> if using the

            <p>
              The Grub Bios partition must be on the drive that the BIOS uses
              to boot the system. This is not necessarily the drive that
              holds the LFS root partition. The disks on a system may use
              different partition table types. The necessity of the Grub Bios
              partition depends only on the partition table type of the boot
              disk.

                  potential boot problems with larger disks, make this the
                  first physical partition on your first disk drive. A

                  builds. The size is generally fairly large and depends on
                  available disk space.

                  "filename">/sbin</code> are symlinks to their counterparts
                  in <code class="filename">/usr</code>. So <code class=
                  "filename">/usr</code> contains all the binaries needed for
                  the system to run. For LFS a separate partition for
                  <code class="filename">/usr</code> is normally not needed.
                  If you create it anyway, you should make a partition large
                  enough to fit all the programs and libraries in the system.
                  The root partition can be very small (maybe just one
                  gigabyte) in this configuration, so it's suitable for a
                  thin client or diskless workstation (where <code class=
                  "filename">/usr</code> is mounted from a remote server).
                  However, you should be aware that an initramfs (not covered
                  by LFS) will be needed to boot a system with a separate

      the Partition
    </h1>
    <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
      <p>
        A partition is just a range of sectors on a disk drive, delimited by
        boundaries set in a partition table. Before the operating system can
        use a partition to store any files, the partition must be formatted
        to contain a file system, typically consisting of a label, directory
        blocks, data blocks, and an indexing scheme to locate a particular
        file on demand. The file system also helps the OS keep track of free
        space on the partition, reserve the needed sectors when a new file is
        created or an existing file is extended, and recycle the free data
        segments created when files are deleted. It may also provide support
        for data redundancy, and for error recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        LFS can use any file system recognized by the Linux kernel, but the
        most common types are ext3 and ext4. The choice of the right file
        system can be complex; it depends on the characteristics of the files
        and the size of the partition. For example:
      </p>
      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl class="variablelist">
          <dt>
            <span class="term">ext2</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              is suitable for small partitions that are updated infrequently
              such as /boot.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">ext3</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              is an upgrade to ext2 that includes a journal to help recover
              the partition's status in the case of an unclean shutdown. It
              is commonly used as a general purpose file system.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">ext4</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              is the latest version of the ext family of file systems. It
              provides several new capabilities including nano-second
              timestamps, creation and use of very large files (up to 16 TB),
              and speed improvements.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
      <p>
        Other file systems, including FAT32, NTFS, JFS, and XFS are useful
        for specialized purposes. More information about these file systems,
        and many others, can be found at <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        LFS assumes that the root file system (/) is of type ext4. To create
        an <code class="systemitem">ext4</code> file system on the LFS
        partition, issue the following command:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">mkfs -v -t ext4 /dev/<em class=
      "replaceable"><code>&lt;xxx&gt;</code></em></kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Replace <em class="replaceable"><code>&lt;xxx&gt;</code></em> with
        the name of the LFS partition.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using an existing <code class="systemitem">swap</code>
        partition, there is no need to format it. If a new <code class=
        "systemitem">swap</code> partition was created, it will need to be
        initialized with this command:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">mkswap /dev/<em class=
      "replaceable"><code>&lt;yyy&gt;</code></em></kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Replace <em class="replaceable"><code>&lt;yyy&gt;</code></em> with
        the name of the <code class="systemitem">swap</code> partition.
      </p>

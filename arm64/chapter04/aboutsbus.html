      <p>
        Many people would like to know beforehand approximately how long it
        takes to compile and install each package. Because Linux From Scratch
        can be built on many different systems, it is impossible to provide
        absolute time estimates. The biggest package (gcc) will take
        approximately 5 minutes on the fastest systems, but could take days
        on slower systems! Instead of providing actual times, the Standard
        Build Unit (SBU) measure will be used instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SBU measure works as follows. The first package to be compiled is
        binutils in <a class="xref" href="../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Compiling a Cross-Toolchain">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.
        The time it takes to compile using one core is what we will refer to
        as the Standard Build Unit or SBU. All other compile times will be
        expressed in terms of this unit of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider a package whose compilation time is 4.5 SBUs.
        This means that if your system took 10 minutes to compile and install
        the first pass of binutils, it will take <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>approximately</em></span> 45 minutes to build the
        example package. Fortunately, most build times are shorter than one
        SBU.
      </p>
      <p>
        SBUs are not entirely accurate because they depend on many factors,
        including the host system's version of GCC. They are provided here to
        give an estimate of how long it might take to install a package, but
        the numbers can vary by as much as dozens of minutes in some cases.
      </p>

          Note
        </h3>
        <p>
          When multiple processors are used in this way, the SBU units in the
          book will vary even more than they normally would. In some cases,
          the make step will simply fail. Analyzing the output of the build
          process will also be more difficult because the lines from
          different processes will be interleaved. If you run into a problem
          with a build step, revert to a single processor build to properly
          analyze the error messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The times presented here are based upon using four cores (-j4). The
          times in Chapter 8 also include the time to run the regression
          tests for the package unless specified otherwise.

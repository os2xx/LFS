          First, remove the currently installed documentation files to
          prevent them from ending up in the final system, and to save about
          35 MB:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">rm -rf /usr/share/{info,man,doc}/*</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          Second, on a modern Linux system, the libtool .la files are only
          useful for libltdl. No libraries in LFS are loaded by libltdl, and
          it's known that some .la files can cause BLFS package failures.
          Remove those files now:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">find /usr/{lib,libexec} -name \*.la -delete</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          The current system size is now about 3 GB, however the /tools
          directory is no longer needed. It uses about 1 GB of disk space.
          Delete it now:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">rm -rf /tools</kbd></pre>
      </div>

        <p>
          At this point the essential programs and libraries have been
          created and your current LFS system is in a good state. Your system
          can now be backed up for later reuse. In case of fatal failures in
          the subsequent chapters, it often turns out that removing
          everything and starting over (more carefully) is the best way to
          recover. Unfortunately, all the temporary files will be removed,
          too. To avoid spending extra time to redo something which has been
          done successfully, creating a backup of the current LFS system may
          prove useful.
        </p>
        <div class="admon note">
          <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />

            Note
          </h3>
          <p>
            All the remaining steps in this section are optional.
            Nevertheless, as soon as you begin installing packages in
            <a class="xref" href="../chapter08/chapter08.html" title=
            "Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>,
            the temporary files will be overwritten. So it may be a good idea
            to do a backup of the current system as described below.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The following steps are performed from outside the chroot
          environment. That means you have to leave the chroot environment
          first before continuing. The reason for that is to get access to
          file system locations outside of the chroot environment to
          store/read the backup archive, which ought not be placed within the
          <code class="filename">$LFS</code> hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have decided to make a backup, leave the chroot environment:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">exit</kbd></pre>
        <div class="admon important">
          <img alt="[Important]" src="../images/important.png" />
          <h3>
            Important
          </h3>
          <p>
            All of the following instructions are executed by <code class=
            "systemitem">root</code> on your host system. Take extra care
            about the commands you're going to run as mistakes made here can
            modify your host system. Be aware that the environment variable
            <code class="envar">LFS</code> is set for user <code class=
            "systemitem">lfs</code> by default but may <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be set for <code class=
            "systemitem">root</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever commands are to be executed by <code class=
            "systemitem">root</code>, make sure you have set <code class=
            "envar">LFS</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This has been discussed in <a class="xref" href=
            "../chapter02/aboutlfs.html" title=
            "2.6.&nbsp;Setting The $LFS Variable">Section&nbsp;2.6, “Setting
            The $LFS Variable.”</a>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Before making a backup, unmount the virtual file systems:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
        "command">mountpoint -q $LFS/dev/shm &amp;&amp; umount $LFS/dev/shm
umount $LFS/dev/pts
umount $LFS/{sys,proc,run,dev}</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          Make sure you have at least 1 GB free disk space (the source
          tarballs will be included in the backup archive) on the file system
          containing the directory where you create the backup archive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the instructions below specify the home directory of the
          host system's <code class="systemitem">root</code> user, which is
          typically found on the root file system. Replace <code class=
          "envar">$HOME</code> by a directory of your choice if you do not
          want to have the backup stored in <code class=
          "systemitem">root</code>'s home directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create the backup archive by running the following command:
        </p>
        <div class="admon note">
          <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />
          <h3>
            Note
          </h3>
          <p>
            Because the backup archive is compressed, it takes a relatively
            long time (over 10 minutes) even on a reasonably fast system.
          </p>
        </div>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">cd $LFS
tar -cJpf $HOME/lfs-temp-tools-12.2.tar.xz .</kbd></pre>
        <div class="admon note">

          <h3>
            Note
          </h3>
          <p>
            If continuing to chapter 8, don't forget to reenter the chroot
            environment as explained in the <span class="quote">“<span class=
            "quote">Important</span>”</span> box below.
          </p>

          7.13.3. Restore
        </h2>
        <p>
          In case some mistakes have been made and you need to start over,
          you can use this backup to restore the system and save some
          recovery time. Since the sources are located under <code class=
          "filename">$LFS</code>, they are included in the backup archive as
          well, so they do not need to be downloaded again. After checking
          that <code class="envar">$LFS</code> is set properly, you can
          restore the backup by executing the following commands:
        </p>
        <div class="admon warning">
          <img alt="[Warning]" src="../images/warning.png" />
          <h3>
            Warning
          </h3>
          <p>
            The following commands are extremely dangerous. If you run
            <span class="command"><strong>rm -rf ./*</strong></span> as the
            <code class="systemitem">root</code> user and you do not change
            to the $LFS directory or the <code class="envar">LFS</code>
            environment variable is not set for the <code class=
            "systemitem">root</code> user, it will destroy your entire host
            system. YOU ARE WARNED.
          </p>
        </div>
        <pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput">cd $LFS
rm -rf ./*
tar -xpf $HOME/lfs-temp-tools-12.2.tar.xz</code></pre>
        <p>
          Again, double check that the environment has been set up properly
          and continue building the rest of the system.
        </p>

            If you left the chroot environment to create a backup or restart
            building using a restore, remember to check that the virtual file
            systems are still mounted (<span class="command"><strong>findmnt
            | grep $LFS</strong></span>). If they are not mounted, remount
            them now as described in <a class="xref" href="kernfs.html"

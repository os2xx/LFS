    <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
      <p>
        The goal of LFS is to build a complete and usable foundation-level
        system—including all the packages needed to replicate itself—and
        providing a relatively minimal base from which to customize a more
        complete system based on the user's choices. This does not mean that
        LFS is the smallest system possible. Several important packages are
        included that are not, strictly speaking, required. The list below
        documents the reasons each package in the book has been included.

              This package contains utilities to administer Access Control
              Lists, which are used to define fine-grained discretionary
              access rights for files and directories.

              This package supplies programs for producing shell scripts that
              can automatically configure source code from a developer's
              template. It is often needed to rebuild a package after the

              This package satisfies an LSB core requirement to provide a
              Bourne Shell interface to the system. It was chosen over other
              shell packages because of its common usage and extensive
              capabilities.

              This package supplies a linker, an assembler, and other tools
              for handling object files. The programs in this package are
              needed to compile most of the packages in an LFS system.

              This package contains a number of essential programs for
              viewing and manipulating files and directories. These programs
              are needed for command line file management, and are necessary

              The elfutils project provides libraries and tools for ELF files
              and DWARF data. Most utilities in this package are available in
              other packages, but the library is needed to build the Linux
              kernel using the default (and most efficient) configuration.

            <p>
              This package implements a portable, high level programming
              interface to various calling conventions. Some programs may not
              know at the time of compilation what arguments are to be passed
              to a function. For instance, an interpreter may be told at
              run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
              given function. Libffi can be used in such programs to provide
              a bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

      <p>
        This chapter includes a list of packages that need to be downloaded
        in order to build a basic Linux system. The listed version numbers
        correspond to versions of the software that are known to work, and
        this book is based on their use. We highly recommend against using
        different versions, because the build commands for one version may
        not work with a different version, unless the different version is
        specified by an LFS erratum or security advisory. The newest package
        versions may also have problems that require work-arounds. These
        work-arounds will be developed and stabilized in the development
        version of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some packages, the release tarball and the (Git or SVN)
        repository snapshot tarball for that release may be published with
        similar file names. A release tarball contains generated files (for
        example, a <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span>
        script generated by <span class=
        "command"><strong>autoconf</strong></span>), in addition to the
        contents of the corresponding repository snapshot. The book uses
        release tarballs whenever possible. Using a repository snapshot
        instead of a release tarball specified by the book will cause
        problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Download locations may not always be accessible. If a download
        location has changed since this book was published, Google (<a class=
        "ulink" href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com/</a>)
        provides a useful search engine for most packages. If this search is
        unsuccessful, try one of the alternative means of downloading at
        <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/mirrors.html#files">https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/mirrors.html#files</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Downloaded packages and patches will need to be stored somewhere that
        is conveniently available throughout the entire build. A working
        directory is also required to unpack the sources and build them.
        <code class="filename">$LFS/sources</code> can be used both as the
        place to store the tarballs and patches and as a working directory.
        By using this directory, the required elements will be located on the
        LFS partition and will be available during all stages of the building
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create this directory, execute the following command, as user
        <code class="systemitem">root</code>, before starting the download
        session:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">mkdir -v $LFS/sources</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Make this directory writable and sticky. <span class=
        "quote">“<span class="quote">Sticky</span>”</span> means that even if
        multiple users have write permission on a directory, only the owner
        of a file can delete the file within a sticky directory. The
        following command will enable the write and sticky modes:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">chmod -v a+wt $LFS/sources</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        There are several ways to obtain all the necessary packages and
        patches to build LFS:
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>
              The files can be downloaded individually as described in the
              next two sections.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>
              For stable versions of the book, a tarball of all the needed
              files can be downloaded from one of the mirror sites listed at
              <a class="ulink" href=
              "https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mirrors.html#files">https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mirrors.html#files</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>
              The files can be downloaded using <span class=
              "command"><strong>wget</strong></span> and a wget-list as
              described below.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        To download all of the packages and patches by using <a class="ulink"
        href="../wget-list-sysv.html">wget-list-sysv</a> as an input to the
        <span class="command"><strong>wget</strong></span> command, use:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">wget --input-file=wget-list-sysv --continue --directory-prefix=$LFS/sources</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Additionally, starting with LFS-7.0, there is a separate file,
        <a class="ulink" href="../md5sums.html">md5sums</a>, which can be used to
        verify that all the correct packages are available before proceeding.
        Place that file in <code class="filename">$LFS/sources</code> and
        run:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">pushd $LFS/sources
  md5sum -c md5sums
popd</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        This check can be used after retrieving the needed files with any of
        the methods listed above.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the packages and patches are downloaded as a non-<code class=
        "systemitem">root</code> user, these files will be owned by the user.
        The file system records the owner by its UID, and the UID of a normal
        user in the host distro is not assigned in LFS. So the files will be
        left owned by an unnamed UID in the final LFS system. If you won't
        assign the same UID for your user in the LFS system, change the
        owners of these files to <code class="systemitem">root</code> now to
        avoid this issue:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">chown root:root $LFS/sources/*</kbd></pre>
